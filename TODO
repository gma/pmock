todo:
+ refactor to match jmock apis more closely (Invokable, Matcher, Stub)
+ default stub behaviour
+ TestCase base class for autoverification of mocks in test case.
+ change error messages to be more similar to the jmock style (unexpected call -> all mockers with state, failed verification -> verification error)
+ change to python license
+ PyPI registration 
+ constrain allowable order of builder methods
+ add constraints and(), not(), or()
+ rename label method back to id
+ build scripts in CVS (Scons?)

possibly:
+ constraint base class to allow non-derived constraints to default to an equality match against the parameter. Would allow more compact argument constraints for the common case of equality e.g. mock.foo('bar').will(...)
+ pull out dispatcher functionality to allow different matching strategies (LIFO, FIFO)?
+ support for properties
